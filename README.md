# Apple Tree - A Swift Programming Hangman Game
This game was developed as part of the 'Develop in Swift Essentials' course. The words to be guessed are all related to Swift programming concepts, such as View, Outlets, and Actions.

**Objective**: Try to guess the correct word and make as many points as possible while preventing apples from falling off the tree. Each incorrect guess causes an apple to drop.
